				<button class="accordion">What is SeasideScans?</button>
				<div class="panel">
				  <p class="normal-paragraph">We're a manga scanlation group that started back in 2014. We're fans of manga just like you who wanted to contribute to the community by giving western enthusiasts the chance to enjoy japanese manga in English soon after the chapters come out in Japan.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Are the chapters free to read?</button>
				<div class="panel">
				  <p class="normal-paragraph">We link the finished chapters to external websites. As of today, none of these ask for a subscription to access the material. However, we always encourage everyone to buy the official manga releases. You'll find links to buy the licensed books from the publishers in the description box of each title.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">How can I donate?</button>
				<div class="panel">
				  <p class="normal-paragraph">We really appreciate your willingness to donate to us. However, we've never accepted and don't plan on accepting donations. We're a non-profit group that does this as a hobby, so we'd be happier if you spent your money supporting the manga industry directly by buying the official English releases.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Will you be translating [Manga]?</button>
				<div class="panel">
				  <p class="normal-paragraph">Please send us your series recommendations via our <a class="regularlink" href="./contact.html">Contact</a> section. If we have the means and our members are willing, we might take you up on your suggestion. Please note that we won't translate a series that another group is already working on.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">When will [Manga] chapter come out?</button>
				<div class="panel">
				  <p class="normal-paragraph">Each series has a different and somewhat irregular schedule. Since we only update our website once the chapters are done, you might want to join our <strong><a href="#">Discord Server</a></strong> for more detailed updates. You'll probably know when the Japanese chapters have come out and when we've started working on them if you do!</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Can I translate your editions to a different language?</button>
				<div class="panel">
				  <p class="normal-paragraph">Yes, we don't mind. Just let us know so we can check it out. We're a curious bunch!</p>
