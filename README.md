# seaside-scans

This is the first website I made, for a fictional manga scanlation group.


## I practiced:

HTML, CSS, flexbox, media queries (desktop first) and a bit of vanilla javascript for the menu and the FAQ section.

In the future I hope to look back to this small project and see how much I've managed to improve my code.
