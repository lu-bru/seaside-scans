				<p class="normal-paragraph">Interested in joining SeasideScans? With many active projects, we are always looking for more awesome people to join our ranks. Note that SeasideScans is a NON-profit making group, so all staff members are doing volunteer work. We do it by the fans for the fans!
				We only require experience for Proofreader positions. We can also provide some training and feedback, all that's needed is the willingness to learn and help out!</p>

							<h3>Translators</h3>
							<br>
							<p class="small-paragraph">They translate the projects to english. We're currently translating directly from Japanese, but we're planing on working on Korean raws soon. The titles we pick up tend to have complete furigana, so an extensive knowledge of kanji isn't required. The translated text is written following a specified format and then shared with the typesetters.</p>

							<h3>Proofreaders</h3>
							<br>
							<p class="small-paragraph">They make sure the translated documents have no mistakes. This involves grammar, sentence structure, spelling, tenses and punctuation. Proofreaders collaborate with the translators and make the wordings flow naturally. Due to the nature of this job, being a native English speaker and having knowledge on different manga genres is required.</p>

						<div class="cardtext">
							<h3>Cleaners</h3>
							<br>
							<p class="small-paragraph">They receive the original scans and "clean" them by straightening, cropping and leveling them, while also removing the original text. Cleaners basically make the scans look pretty and prepare them to hold the English content. Having a drawing tablet is recommended for the redrawing task, and using Photoshop is required for file sharing.</p>

						<div class="cardtext">
							<h3>Typesetters</h3>
							<br>
							<p class="small-paragraph">They take the cleaned pages and add in the translation. To make the editions as loyal as posible to the originals, typesetters use the Japanese raws to see where each text goes, without the need to understand the language. We usually follow the same guidelines, but being able to pick the right fonts for each panel and situation is nonetheless required.</p>
